# Actor - Goodreads Scraper

## Goodreads scraper

Since Goodreads doesn't provide a good and free API, this actor should help you to retrieve data from it.

The Goodreads data scraper supports the following features:

-   Search any keyword - You can search any keyword you would like to have and get the results

-   Scrape lists - Scrape any list that you'd like to get from Goodreads

-   Scrape shelf - You can check the shelves and scrape the information of the newest updates.

-   Scrape genres - If you want to get most read books on a certain category or anything related the genres, just type the url.

-   Scrape book detail - Scrape a very detailed information for each of the book that you'd like to get.

-   Scrape reviews of a book - Scrape all of the reviews from a book optionally.

## Input Parameters

The input of this scraper should be JSON containing the list of pages on Goodreads that should be visited. Required fields are:

| Field                | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| search               | String  | (optional) Keyword that you want to search on Goodreads.                                                                                                                                                       |
| includeReviews       | Boolean | (optional) This will add all the reviews that Goodreads provides inside the book object. Please keep in mind that the time and resources the actor uses will increase proportionally by the number of reviews. |
| startUrls            | Array   | (optional) List of Goodreads URLs. You should only provide news list, jobs list or detail URLs                                                                                                                 |
| endPage              | Integer | (optional) Final number of page that you want to scrape. Default is `Infinite`. This is applies to all `search` request and `startUrls` individually.                                                          |
| maxItems             | Integer | (optional) You can limit scraped products. This should be useful when you search through the big subcategories.                                                                                                |
| proxy                | Object  | Proxy configuration                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| extendOutputFunction | String  | (optional) Function that takes a JQuery handle ($) as argument and returns object with data                                                                                                                    |

This solution requires the use of **Proxy servers**, either your own proxy servers or you can use [Apify Proxy](https://www.apify.com/docs/proxy).

##### Tip

When you want to have a scrape over a specific listing URL, just copy and paste the link as one of the **startUrl**.

If you would like to scrape only the first page of a list then put the link for the page and have the `endPage` as 1.

With the last approach that explained above you can also fetch any interval of pages. If you provide the 5th page of a list and define the `endPage` parameter as 6 then you'll have the 5th and 6th pages only.

### Compute Unit Consumption

The actor optimized to run blazing fast and scrape many as listings as possible. Therefore, it forefronts all listing detail requests. If actor doesn't block very often it'll scrape 100 listings in 2 minutes with ~0.03-0.05 compute units.

### Goodreads Scraper Input example

```json
{
    "startUrls": [
        "https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=stephen",
        "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41865.Twilight",
        "https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/99918.Cassie_s_Cover_of_the_Year_2016",
        "https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/art",
        "https://www.goodreads.com/genres/most_read/christian-fiction"
    ],
    "includeReviews": false,
    "proxy": {
        "useApifyProxy": true
    },
    "endPage": 5,
    "maxItems": 100
}
```

## During the Run

During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified.
When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.

## Goodreads Export

During the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any languague (Python, PHP, Node JS/NPM). See the FAQ or <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/api" target="blank">our API reference</a> to learn more about getting results from this Goodreads actor.
